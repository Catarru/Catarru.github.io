# Project Change Request

## Proposed Change
Update our website homepage to feature a customizable weather map offering global forecasts, with a focus on wind patterns, precipitation, and temperature trends.
- The proposal is to embed a map generated by Windy.com into the HTML code of our website homepage.
- Map configurations can be customized including appearance options of the wind, rain, and temperature.
- Windy.com pulls data from trusted global weather forecast models such as the NOAA Global Forecast System and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.
- Because Windy.com does not use cookies or any other tracking software, it is a safe and useful addition to our website

## Reasons for the Change
This change is proposed to provide value to our stakeholders.

## How This Change Will Add Value
This change enhances our website by adding an interactive weather map that encourages visitor engagement, increases time spent on the site, and elevates the value of our digital real estate for sponsor advertising.

## How This Change Will Affect the Constraints
This change will have minimal effect on the constraints.
- The weather map is easily embedded into our HTML code.
- It has no user tracking or cookies
- It will not disrupt our existing content, nor will it cause any performance issues
- If implemented, the update would offer high value with little to no risk
