# Final Project Scope Statement

## Project Name 
* Team Manager's Toolbox

## Project Purpose
Why is this project being done?
   - To create a group of digital tools that can be repeatedly utilized, in a systematic manner, to successfully manage a team of adjusters during a deployment.
   - Each tool will serve as a reminder of required tasks for both the manager, as well as each team member that receives notice of an individual task they need to complete.
   - There will be three separate tracking tools: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly

## Description
How would you describe this project?
   - During this project, tools will be created, utilizing computer applications, that will provide a clear and concise path for the manager of an adjuster team to fulfill the requirements of their position.
   - The use of these tools will ensure the timely completion of daily, weekly, and monthly management responsibilities, as well as highlight adjuster tasks that need attention for the manager to recognize and address the neglected requirement with the individual adjuster before it develops into a larger issue.

## Desired Results
What specific outcomes must we achieve to be successful?
   - To be successful, the tools must include all known management requirements that must be fulfilled from the beginning of the deployment until the end.
   - This must be tested in a pre-deployment environmant so that corrections can be made before the tools are utilized in an active situation because there will be very little time to make adjustments once the deployment begins.

## Exclusions
What is out of the projectâ€™s scope and should NOT be included?
   - If the individual adjuster is not completing their work in a timely manner, or within the company guidelines, the scope of work for the manager will not include actions to conduct work for the adjuster.

## Priorities
1. Time: 
   -  Plan must be ready to impliment by the end of next week - Friday, 10/03/2025
2. Quality: 
   - Easy to impliment as soon as deployment begins
   - Clear and concise instructions for the manager and the team
   - Will provide consistent and professional output that needs little editing for documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
Who needs to sign off on the project and when?
   - Christine Urrata - Team Manager awaiting deployment.
   - The manager who intends to utilize the Team Manager's Toolbox.
